Today I was working on one of Maven Analytics challenge and have designed my first Power Bi dashboard. However, I was being very hesitant to start with this challenge so took some help from Youtube and other sources and finally come up with a dashboard of mine.

I have learnt and used some amazing functionalities like-
✅ Data Modelling.
✅ Conversion of time to several time ranges using Power Query.
✅ Conditional formatting in Power Bi.

So,Here is my version of "Maven Pizza Place Sales Analysis". However, I know I have passed the deadline for this challenge but I would love to have your remarks on this dashboard Maven Analytics.

If anyone wants to give it a try then you can. You can get the data freely from Maven website.

Thanks, Maven Analytics for providing data freely for everyone to improve their analytical skills.

It was a great learning experience and a fun challenge to work.
